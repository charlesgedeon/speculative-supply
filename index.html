    <h1>Speculative Supply</h1>
    <h2>Open-source tools for speculating across a variety of contexts</h2>
    <div class="alert alert-info">We have just started on this endeavor and appreciate any collaborations and feedback</div>
    <p>
      Welcome to Speculative Supply. This is an ever-growing set of tools whose intention it is to democratize speculation and put it in the hands of the masses. Our belief is that speculation leads to learning, pattern recognition in the events around us, and discovery.

    <h3>Speculation Game <em>(Name TBD)</em></h3>

        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>Speculation Game consists of a set of two decks of rotating context cards, that can create a multitude of context pairs. Each pair reflects a plausible reality, where the two displayed contexts make an impact on each other, creating a plausible desirable or undesirable outcomes (the game user makes that subjective judgment while playing). Each outcome is recorded on the chart/ paper in a form of a speculation tree, allowing the existing speculations to join one of the context decks, thereby also being speculated on.  Such an addition creates a next level of speculation. It is advised that a game goes on for three consecutive levels, in order for the speculation tree to grow big enough to reach highly abstract predictions on the future. In theory, the game can be played ad infinitum while its records can serve as a platform for debate with other users. The Russian Roulette character of generating speculations ensures both highly unpredictable context pairs, and highly controversial speculations to tackle. In its mobile app version, the game users register with user profiles, while their speculation trees stay on record and are open to a peer-to-peer review.</p>

        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>We often get involved in change work and just do things until it starts to lose meaning for us and we have our first activist depression, or we go through an upsurge and get disorientated by the downturn of a movement. With the beginning of articulating our theory of change we can treat social action more as an experiment and evaluate our involement more usefully/ sustainably. More than that though, social change work is populated by people telling us to believe in the theory they subscribe to. Making our own theory through question asking about our perspectives and values is far more liberatory and fun!</p>
