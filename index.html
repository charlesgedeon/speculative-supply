    <h2>Open-source tools for speculating across a variety of contexts</h2>
    <div class="alert alert-info">We have just started on this endeavor and appreciate any collaborations and feedback</div>
    <p>
      Welcome to Speculative Supply. This is an ever-growing set of tools whose intention it is to democratize speculation and put it in the hands of the masses. Our belief is that speculation leads to learning, pattern recognition in the events around us, and discovery.

        <p>We often get involved in change work and just do things until it starts to lose meaning for us and we have our first activist depression, or we go through an upsurge and get disorientated by the downturn of a movement. With the beginning of articulating our theory of change we can treat social action more as an experiment and evaluate our involement more usefully/ sustainably. More than that though, social change work is populated by people telling us to believe in the theory they subscribe to. Making our own theory through question asking about our perspectives and values is far more liberatory and fun!</p>
