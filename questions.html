		<h2>What if school asked “what if?”?</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>What if classes were not split by subject but by interesting “what if” questions?</li>
			<li>What if the answers to those questions were conversations that involved fact, opinion, and speculation?</li>
			<li>What if those conversations were logged and parsed into smaller, more understandable components?</li>
			<li>What if those components were visible to the students and we allowed them to form opinions about their own progress?</li>
			<li>What if those opinions were then assessed by the teacher who will either reinforce the behaviour, if the student wants it, or help correct it?</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Questions about learning mechanics within speculation</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>What is it about drawing connections between things that’s so compelling as a learning mechanic?</li>
			<li>How can we demonstrate to people that any and every conversation is loaded with details that are in fact connected to learning?</li>
		</ul>
